# It's my README.md file

### Really boring philosophical things
Well... I would like to start by saying that I know very little about programming. I'm really new, and I guess this README.md turned out to be poor. But I think it's better than nothing. I use a translator, so don't be surprised if any sentence seems strange. I tried to reduce all sentences and words to familiar ones, but no one is perfect in a foreign language...

### That's my top (programming) langs

### Fin
This was really short README.md... I hope it gets longer soon
